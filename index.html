              Moment by moment, the body remembers how to soften. Breath deepens,
              nervous systems sync, warmth returns to the places that once felt
              frozen. This is the cadence of healing that Seva holds space for —
              courageous, intimate, and beautifully human.

              <p>Welcome to your path of transformation and healing.</p>
              <p>
                Life’s challenges — whether trauma, grief, anxiety, addiction, or
                major life changes — can feel overwhelming. You don’t have to face
                them alone. This space is here for you if you’re ready to heal,
                grow, and rediscover your inner strength.
              </p>
              <p>
                Since 2005, I’ve supported individuals, couples, and families as
                they overcome obstacles and embrace positive change. Together, we
                tailor each step to your unique needs so you can break free from
                limiting patterns and cultivate lasting resilience.

              <h4>Why Therapy?</h4>
              <p>
                Therapy is a powerful invitation into self-exploration, healing,
                and personal growth. It’s a place where you can slow down, be heard,
                and rewire the way you meet your world.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Understand and transform the challenges that hold you back.</li>
                <li>Break free from negative patterns and cultivate healthier habits.</li>
                <li>Gain clarity, confidence, and resilience for life’s evolutions.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Using modalities such as NLP, Reverse Therapy, Solution-Oriented
                Therapy, and Positive Psychology, every session is crafted to
                meet you exactly where you are — and to open the possibility of
                where you want to go. Together, we’ll explore what’s keeping you
                stuck and unlock the possibilities for a brighter, more
                fulfilling future.

                <h4>A unique approach to therapy</h4>
                <p>
                  My work is deeply inspired by Milton Erickson, the pioneer of
                  medical hypnosis and family therapy whose methods continue to
                  shape modern hypnotherapy.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Training with Stephen Gilligan, Bill O’Hanlon, Dr. Richard
                  Bandler, and Paul McKenna allows me to integrate Ericksonian
                  techniques, NLP, and Positive Psychology into every session.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Whatever you are navigating — chronic fatigue, addiction,
                  relationship difficulties, or emotional blocks — I’ll stand by
                  you with guidance and tools to reclaim your life.
