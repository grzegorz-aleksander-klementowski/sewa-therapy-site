				<h2>A Unique Approach to Therapy</h2>
				<p>My work is deeply inspired by Milton Erickson, a pioneer in medical hypnosis and
					family therapy whose groundbreaking methods shaped modern hypnotherapy. His
					influence runs through everything I do &mdash; meeting the unconscious with
					respect, curiosity, and creativity.</p>
				<p>I've had the privilege of training with Stephen Gilligan, Bill O'Hanlon, Dr. Richard
					Bandler, and Paul McKenna &mdash; leading experts in hypnotherapy, NLP, and
					transformational psychology. By integrating their techniques with insights from
					Positive Psychology, I've developed a distinctive approach that helps clients
					achieve lasting personal transformation.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>No matter your struggles &mdash; whether chronic fatigue, addiction, relationship
					difficulties, or emotional blocks &mdash; I will provide the guidance and tools
					you need to reclaim control of your life. Together we turn compassion into
					momentum.</p>

					<p>Every collaboration is grounded in respect, confidentiality, and an
						unwavering belief that meaningful change is possible when you know
